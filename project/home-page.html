            The UEFA European Championship, commonly referred to as the Euros,

          <h2>How to qualify for the Euros</h2>
          <p>
            To qualify for the UEFA European Championship (the Euros), national
            football teams from UEFA's member associations must go through a
            rigorous qualification process. This process typically begins with a
            draw that divides the teams into groups, usually based on their
            performance in previous competitions and their UEFA rankings. Each
            group consists of several teams that play home and away matches
            against each other. Points are awarded based on match results, with
            three points for a win, one point for a draw, and none for a loss.
            The teams with the highest points in each group, along with the
            best-performing runners-up, usually secure direct qualification.
            Additionally, there are playoff rounds for teams that did not
            qualify directly, giving them another chance to compete for a spot
            in the tournament. This structure ensures that the strongest and
            most consistent teams earn their place in the Euros, providing a
            high level of competition and excitement.
